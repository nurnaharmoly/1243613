                            <dd>The Daily Star established its place in the media scene of Bangladesh on January 14, 1991. 
                                It started its journey with a sense of challenge and a feeling of humility to serve this nation as a truly independent newspaper.<br>
                                The newspaper made its debut at a historic time when, with the fall of an autocratic regime, 
                                the country was well set to begin a new era towards establishing a democratic system of government which eluded Bangladesh for too long.</dd>
                            <br>
                            <dt>OBJECTIVE</dt><br>
                            <dd>The Daily Star carries on with the long-term responsibility is to strengthen public opinion on how the democratic system should work and how to sustain and nurture democratic norms effectively.
                                It was a privilege for The Daily Star to be part of a changing scene after the fall of military autocrat in early 1990s. With that privilege came an enormous responsibility of upholding the duties of a free press.</dd>

                            <dd>The uniqueness of The Daily Star lies in its non-partisan position, in the freedom it enjoys from any influence of political parties or vested groups.
                                Its strength is in taking position of neutrality in conflicts between good and evil, justice and injustice, right and wrong, regardless of positions held by any group or alliance.
